Options and Variants: Overview
==============================

Provides the ability to dynamically position configurable elements of the product structure without having to create additional occurrences to capture potential resulting positions. This saves time by removing additional work associated with capturing these occurrences in CAD and reducing the quantity of expressions required to manage the structure.


Additional Details
------------------
Windchill can dynamically position components in a configured product structure for purposes of visualizing the configured product or opening the configuration in CAD to perform design work.
To capture the positioning logic, the **Architecture Editor** and **Locators tab** are introduced in the part structure browser:

• **Architecture Editor:** Allows you to view and author the positioning architecture for a configurable product. This can be launched from the part actions for a configurable part. The positioning architecture helps capture the configuration logic that is used to assemble a configurable product.
• **Locators tab:** Allows you to view and manage locators defined for a configurable module. Locators are used to position configurable modules relative to another configurable module in the positioning architecture.
